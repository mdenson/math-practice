# math-practice

A simple webapp for young math practice. This is meant as a demo/toy app to get kids more practice. My daughter is always asking for me to write math problems for her and this seemed like a fun way to do that.

## TODO:

-   Update to Material Components for the Web as Material Design Lite is no longer supported
-   Fix negative numbers and/or allow option to keep this simple
-   Option to set num_limit (largest individual number)
-   Refactor to make this more practical
