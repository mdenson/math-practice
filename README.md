# math-practice

A simple webapp for youth math practice in addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This is meant as a demo/toy app to entice young kids to practice more often. My daughter kept asking me to write math problems for her to practice with and this seemed like a fun way to do that.

## TODO:

-   Update to [Material Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) since [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) is no longer supported
-   Rearrange operands so that subtraction doesn't give negative results to keep this simple or set as option
-   Option to set num_limit (operand limit)
-   Needs to be refactored
